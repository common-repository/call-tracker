== Description ==

Need to track your calls? Want to understand which ads are working? Easily track where you get calls from with our trackable number widget. Our plugin dynamically changes the displayed phone number on your web page depending on the source of the traffic. This way, you can use a unique phone number plus call forwarding for each traffic source you want to track.

How it works:

Simply select or add a referrer URL and associate to a unique smart number from HitCrowd. When a customer or visitor comes from one of the referred marketing channels, the plugin will display the appropriate phone number. That way, when a customer decides to make a call from your website you will know which channel they made the call by referencing your Hitcrowd call logs. It's that simple.

Call tracker is perfect for showing that your marketing initiatives are really working. Some great channels to use our call tracker tool are Google Adwords, organic search traffic, Bing Ads, Local Online Directories (e.g. Superpages), and more. You can track virtually any type of online traffic source. All you just need to do is enter the domain for the site and associate to a Hitcrowd smart number.
